            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report has revealed that Pakistan wastes $4 billion worth of food every year. This is a shocking revelation given that the country is home to millions of people who are unable to access basic food items.According to the details, the report by the Ministry of National Food Security & Research reveals that Pakistan yearly wastes 26% of its food production yearly.

        <h3>People who're not able to buy Food</h3>
        <div class="sec1">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the World Food Programme, 43 percent of Pakistan's population faces food insecurity. Of this number, 18 percent of people in Pakistan severely lack access to food. This is linked to the fact that most of these people are heavily dependent on agriculture for a living.</p>

        <h3>Malnutrition Due to lack Food</h3>
        <div class="sec1">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lack of adequate nutrition for children contributes to the high number of child and maternal deaths. Approximately 40 percent of children under the age of five are underweight and more than half are affected by stunting. The body's natural defense mechanisms are also weakened as a result of poor diet.</p>
